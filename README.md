# 🚀 Tracking Service

## 📌 Purpose
**Tracking Service** is a backend service designed to collect and manage user behavior data across marketing products and platforms. Its main goal is to provide a centralized way to understand how users interact with systems, campaigns, and features.

## 🎯 Why This Service Exists
In a marketing-oriented system, user behavior data is critical for decision-making. 
> Tracking Service is created to **separate tracking concerns from core business logic**, allowing other services to focus on their own responsibilities while still benefiting from reliable behavior data.

## ✨ Key Benefits
*   **Centralized Tracking:** Unified user behavior tracking across multiple products.
*   **Actionable Insights:** Better understanding of user journeys and interaction patterns.
*   **Measure Effectiveness:** Support for measuring marketing campaign performance.
*   **Data Integration:** Easier data analysis and integration with reporting or analytics systems.
*   **Scalability:** Improved system performance by isolating tracking workloads.

## ⚠️ Limitations
*   The service focuses **only** on collecting and exposing tracking data.
*   It does **not** perform advanced analytics or reporting by itself.
*   Data accuracy depends on correct event tracking from client systems.
*   Real-time insights may be limited without additional processing components.

## 🔭 Scope
Tracking Service is intended to be used as a **shared internal service** within a broader marketing ecosystem, supporting analytics, reporting, and decision-making processes.
